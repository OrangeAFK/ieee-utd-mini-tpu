// tb_ub: unit bench for ub.
//
// DUT          rtl/ctrl/ub/ub.sv, AW = 13
// Reference    a plain array of 8,192 x 64 bits in the bench, written in step with the DUT,
//              and a model write pointer. Every read is checked exactly RD_LAT cycles later.
// Assertions   the model write pointer never passes 8,192. rd_data is not X, RD_LAT cycles
//              after reading an address that was written.
// Must hit     address 0 and 8,191 written and read; reads on consecutive cycles; the same
//              address read twice in a row; wr_rst in the middle of a fill.
// Done when    every task below passes and synthesized alone ub shows 16 RAMB36E1.
// Spec         docs/verification.md, section 6.3. docs/architecture.md, section 6.3.
//
// Each test in the plan is a task below; the initial block runs them in order.
// Bench rules: docs/verification.md, section 2.
